### Summary

This program can be used for any election, using the same format for the raw data and file name. 
If you wanted to capture more information you could modify the python sctipt to add that by increasing the size of the arrays and adjusting the outputs. This new data would be put in a new column in the input file. You could add more candidates by adjusting the array sizes also.
